## App Features

### Sign up
To sign up, you will be required to enter your full name, user name, password, bio (short description of self). Some of these information are required before the form is submitted in the first place. For instance, you have to have a password and username. You can sign up without a profile picture though. When you sign up, you will be directed to the home page where you will be able to interact with other users

### Sign in
You can sign in with your username and password. Once you sign in, your details will be saved in a cookie, so whenever you change browsers you can come back and won't need to sign in any more with your username and password. You will be taken directly to the home page. Directly inputting the url for login or signup page will get you directed to the home page if you are already signed in (thus saving you the energy to type the username and password again. You're welcome ðŸ˜Š)

### Chat with Other Users (Yaay!)
You can look up any users using their usernames in the search section and chat with them. They'll get your message instantly. You'll get theirs instantly too. You can also view some of your favorite contacts right above the search section that provides some of the contacts you have chatted with.

One more thing...

You can also chat with yourself. Yes. Just look up yourself in the favorites section or the search section and click on it. Doing that will get yourself on both the sending and receiving sides of the text message. You can use this for note taking, listing your todos, or whatever. The choice is yours really.

### Log out
Life is not all about chatting. You'll find this button useful sometimes. If you're tired of chatting, just click on it. It is on the top right side of the page. Be sure to return once in a while though.
